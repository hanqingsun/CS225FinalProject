Make sure you have ocaml 4.06.0, and ppx_deriving installed.

    > opam switch 4.06.0
    > opam install ppx_deriving


There is an included Makefile that will build all *.ml files in the current
directory as the default target:

    > make

If you want to execute a file, for example, ec1.ml, just execute:

    > make ec1
